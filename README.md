Scripts: Ansible, Linux Shell, Python, maybe some WebLogic Script

An Intended area, just starting to share to general Public script, Lessons Learned, knowledge that I have Stumbled on ( most likely OVER. ) 
I have internal based Enterprise GitHub accounts that I primarily share code with teammates, so Lack of Movement on this Side is NOT a Negative Sign of ANYTHING.
